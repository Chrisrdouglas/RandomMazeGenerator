# RandomMazeGenerator
This is a homework assignment from a data structures class taken during my time in community college. The objective was to produce a randomly generated maze that starts in the upper left hand corner of the screen and ends in the lower right hand corner.  The objective was to combine several different types of data structures we had learned in the summer course such as Stacks, Queues, and Disjoint Sets (union find). Additionally I had to use algorithms such as Depth-First search and Breadth-First search to find the exit of the maze. An optional objective was to use C++ and compile it from the command line using g++
